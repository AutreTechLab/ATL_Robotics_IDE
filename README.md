# ATL Robotics IDE for Educational Robotics powered by ROS2 and Blockly
The AutreTechLab (ATL) Robotics IDE (or Integrated Development Environment) is a redesign of the [AutreTechLab Blockly Suite](https://github.com/AutreTechLab/ATL_Blockly_Suite). to take advantage of the powerful POS2 middle-ware.Using ROS2 will simplify the design and facilitate the integration of various educational robots such as Cozmo, Thymio II and our own Arduino and Rasberry PI powered kits. 

## Objective
Our goal is to introduce children and young people between the ages of 8 and 18 to the world of technology and coding through the use of robotics.

While most of the students quickly understand the different mechanical parts of a robot, understanding the underlying software is something that takes quite a bit of effort. Most robots have they own development environment, programming language and simulation platforms. 
<br>
In order to facilitate and accelerate the first steps, we have set ourselves the following challenges. 

- How can we reduce the "coding skills" entry barrier and be creative and have fun from day one?
- How can we experiment with different robot platforms without having to dive deep into the corresponding development environments and coding languages?

AutreTechLab (ATL) Robotics IDE for Educational Robotics provides a web-based Blockly programming environment that supports a classroom environment and allows our students to experiment with all our educational robots and experimental setups.
